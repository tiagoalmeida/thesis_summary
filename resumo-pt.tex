\section{Motivation}\label{sec:motiva}

Smartphones' sales surpassed PCs' sales, along with the number of smartphones' end-users (the ones that ultimately use the smartphone). This end-users want highly customizable applications in quantity for their devices. 
This makes it impractical for a software developers to ``foresee'' every possible development combination and provide all users with the best possible application for him. 

A possible solution to make customizable applications is to empower end-users with \emph{end-user programming} (EUP) tools. 
EUP is \emph{``the practice by which end users write computer programs to satisfy a specific need, but programming is not their primary job function''} \cite{EUSEReport}.
That EUP tool could be a collaborative framework, where novices and experts can co-exist and share their implementations, while end-users explore their requirements. With such scenario, expert programmers can create components that end-users can connect using a \emph{visual programming language} (VPL). Such tool could not only reduce the number of ``small'', similar, specific-tailored applications, but also foster discovery and experimentation by end-users.

\section{Objectives}\label{sec:goals}

While developing an EUP tool, we set our goals in answering to the following problems with a working prototype:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{\textbf{Smartphone's limitations in the implementation of a EUP solution}
    VPLs can be hard to use in small screens. How can we use visual elements without overflowing the screen? Is a typical data-flow solution with zoom enough? Can we use VPLs in small screens and work with solutions with medium to large number of components?}
	
	\item{\textbf{Defining an abstraction level for a collaborative framework}
	Higher abstraction levels may be good for end-users but they can limit the blocks produced by expert programmers. Can we achieve a balanced abstraction level for both end-users and expert programmers?}
  
	\item{\textbf{Block reuse in EUP} 
    How can we approach reuse of components and incite end-users to use it?
    Could we benefit from a market for sharing components? What other reuse possibilities can be explored?}
	
\end{itemize}

\section{From Android to Scala: Steps into a EUP solution}\label{sec:work}

For approaching the problems at hand, we started by looking into literature regarding EUP problems \cite{Barriers2004} which quickly raised awareness on another topic: \emph{End-User Software Engineering} (EUSE).
Additionally, we found out that VPLs are a way to solve some of those problems \cite{Navarro2001}, so we also studied these languages.

With the gathered knowledge, a prototype for Android using concepts from VPLs was developed and improved according to end-users feedback obtained from informal experimentation. 
A common problem detected by end-users was the amount of blocks necessary to do simple tasks. To solve this issue we thought in a rewrite rule system and we decided to experiment a new language to do this system: Scala \cite{ProgrammingScala}.

\subsection{A Typed Block-based Prototype}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=.43]{block_example.pdf}}
\caption{A task composed by a set of blocks.} 
\label{fig:block}
\end{figure}

Representing a function or an algorithm as a block, with inputs and outputs, was already used in software engineering, p.e., in black box testing \cite{BlackBoxTesting}, and it was already thought for EUP~\cite{Zin2011}. Both outputs and inputs are called connectors and each connector has a type. An output can be connected with an input and a set of connected blocks creates another block that might be reused. 

A block can be shown to the end-user using a box with inputs on the left and outputs on the right. 
Blocks can be developed by expert programmers and end-users can connect them. A set of connected blocks define a task, and a task is, itself, a block that can be connected with other blocks to create new tasks.

Figure \ref{fig:block} shows that a block can connect its outputs with inputs from other block. This figure also shows a task that automatically replies to a received message with the content ``I am busy. Call you later'' when the message received is from the number ``+351910000000''. The equal blocks has two set of inputs: \texttt{A} and  \texttt{B}, that are the values to be compared; \texttt{True} and \texttt{False}, that are the values that will be used in case the expression \texttt{A == B} is true or false. The \texttt{Value} output will hold the value from \texttt{True} or \texttt{False} depending on the expression's result. 

Tasks can be created in our prototype through an expansible two column layout. Initially there are two columns on the screen that can be used to add and connects blocks. When the end-users want to connect blocks to the blocks on the right column he can do a swipe gesture from the right to the left. With this gesture, the blocks from the right column will pass to the left column and a new empty column appears in the right.

\subsection{Experiments with a Rewrite Rule System}

Despite usability improvements that were introduced in the prototype based on end-users' feedback, we still needed a way to do automatic simplifications in a set of blocks, and other way to convert connectors' types without recurring
to extra blocks. To solve these two problems we tried to use Scala.

Scala provides two main features that were relevant for the described problems: \emph{pattern matching} and \emph{implicit conversions}. Pattern matching allowed us to search for patterns in a set of connected blocks in an easy way, and implicit conversions allowed us to define some conversions without the need to cast or use conversion functions in connectors types. In Java, if we want to convert from a \texttt{String} to \texttt{Integer} we can do: \texttt{Integer.parseInt(string)}. In Scala we can define an implicit,
and every time a \texttt{String} is used and an \texttt{Integer} was expected, the implicit conversion would be automatically called by the compiler.

Using these two features we created a rewrite rule system. This system was built to automatically simplify situations such as: when a set of blocks has two constants being summed then create a constant to replace it. In lower level, there is no actual replacement on the system's behavior, but a visual abstraction is provided instead. 

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}\label{sec:conclui}

We couldn't use the rewrite rule system due to the early stage of adoption of the Scala language within Android devices, with slow and troublesome compilation being the more relevant issues. However, our prototype built with Java is fully functional, allowing expert programmers to add new blocks to it and end-users to use these in their own compositions. This way, end-users can build customized tasks that are useful in their daily activities. However, this devices have a reduced screen size so we provided a scalable solution that splits the composition horizontally, allowing the user to navigate through several blocks were the data flows in the task. 

Collected feedback from end-users allowed us to understand what their priorities and needs, from which we noticed that end-users prefer tasks that have fewer blocks. We also saw that some end-users couldn't understand the task creation process during the first usage, but a small oral explanation was enough for getting them started. Therefore, we included a small tutorial in the prototype, explaining the task creation process.

As part of our future work, we intent to perform quasi-experiments with end-users to validate our implementation. For that, we will provide end-users with a script to follow and measure their ability to perform each step regarding time, intuitiveness, errors performed and comments. A final questionnaire will provide us with feedback regarding the application and their opinion about it. Such information will be relevant to understand usability defects in the application, providing us with the necessary information to improve it. After maturity is achieved, we plan to publish the application on the Android market. Future versions might include blocks (and tasks) sharing between users as downloadable plugins from inside the application itself.
